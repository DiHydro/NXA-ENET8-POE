# NXA-ENET8-POE
This is my effort to cross flash the AMX NXA-ENET8-POE to the ECS2100-10P OEM firmware.
NXA-ENET8-POE_V1.1.2.5.bix is the current running firmware. The board has a ROM chip with this version printed on the sticker. ECS2100_Jump.V117.8.8.1.bix is a 
special file, because the location of some memory supposedly changed in later versions. ECS2100_Special2_1.2.2.0_0731.bix is the next "mainline" firmware after the 
"Jump". Then ECS2100_C1.2.2.31.bix is the final and latest firmware that I am trying to get running as the end result.
